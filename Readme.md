## The story so far

I passed the TribleByte quiz and they suggest building mindsweeper, I actually don't know the rules to minesweeper. Don't think it's the time to learn on that particular subject either. Regardless, countless reviews said try making a game or maze solver so today I worked on that. Beyond this I am sure many projects will be bor in this folder. Only to die here as well. Reguardless maybe if you pick it apart you might find something neat, new, novel or just plain trashy. Regaurdless I wish you look.

### The maze solver

Currently works on simple mazes....what sue me, I'm just a Ops guy, I don't know how to dev.
